### Email 1: Problem Identification (Day 0)
**Subject**: Are you losing 23% on every shipment?
**Preheader**: The manual rate checking problem (and how to fix it)

**Body**:
Hi [First Name],

I was reviewing logistics companies in [City/Region] and noticed something consistent: most small logistics companies are losing an average of 23% margin on every shipment due to manual rate checking.

The math is brutal:
- 6-8 hours daily checking rates across 12+ carriers
- Spreadsheet chaos with outdated rates
- Missed consolidation opportunities
- Constant carrier negotiation headaches

But here's what's working for companies like yours:

**Case Study**: 3-person logistics company saved $8,400/month by automating rate optimization. They went from chaotic spreadsheets to automated profit tracking in 7 days.

I've documented their exact system (and 12 templates they use) here:

The system shows you:

2. The exact templates for route optimization
